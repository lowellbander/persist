draw in all your dimensions

ideas
-----
- [ ] draw straight lines (requires either trememendous filtering or stop&go commands)
- [ ] play back a sketch
- [ ] manipulate objects (which requires that drawings reference some sort of class object as opposed to treating the drawspace as some sort of three dimensional array (how are other drawing programs written?))
